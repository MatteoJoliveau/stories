Hello!

You found my Stories website. This is where I keep all the things I write in my spare time, some good, some bad, and some I just want to get out of my mind to scratch some itch.

For the moment this site is pretty empty. I suggest you head on to the [Series](/series) section, where you will find some more content. They are primarily [Solo RPG](https://rpgmuseum.fandom.com/wiki/Solo) series at the moment, but who knows what I'll conjure up in the future.
