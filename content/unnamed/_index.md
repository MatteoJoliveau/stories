**Unnamed** is a pen-and-paper RPG system designed to be a middleground between narrative-focused systems, such as [Skyfarer], [Lady Blackbird], [Broken Tales], and [Cthulhu Dark], and more mechanics-heavy games like [Dungeons & Dragons], [Pathfinder], and [Call of Cthulhu].

The need for Unnamed arose when I was trying to find a game for a group of players that had already aquired some confidence with tabletop
RPGs by playing some of the more lightweight systems, but wasn't quite ready yet to dive straight into a session of number-crunching D&D.
Also, the few intermediate system I found were quite strongly tied to a specific playstyle or setting, making it difficult to come up
with my own stories without hacking the base system. I therefore decided to design a game of my own that would integrate all the features I liked from the other games while keeping itself generic enough.

The [base system] is available for free under the [Open Game License]. It is free to use as the base system for your own content, even in commercially published materials, as long as you comply with the terms of the license and give proper attribution.

Note that additional material published on this website for Unnamed, like adventures and other supplemental modules, may be published under
other licenses and terms.
