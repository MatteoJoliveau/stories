  bio: >
    Hailing from the northern lands of Italy, my day job as a software developer gives me plenty of 
    free time to write, play games and watch movies. Roleplaying games are a dear passion of mine, and
    this website was born out of the lack of playgroups in my area. Solo RPGs give me a creative outlet
    to improvise, dream, and throw some dice around.
