**Iurevard** is a fascinating continent, a land with strong connections to its past and traditions, yet shook to its core
by the inexorable advance of progress that is revolutionizing the mainland. In a world where magic is held as the supreme
source of power by the elite and used to create and maintain control over the people, technology is rapidly growing and
evolving, giving the common folk the tools to improve their condition and claim their independence.

The **official setting guide** provide all the information needed to create and run adventures set in Iurevard, including
political, geographical, and historical backgrounds for both the continent and the factions that inhabit it, new custom
classes and game mechanics that enhance the traditional fantasy elements with new and exiting aspects related to technology,
progress and 19th century-style machines. In this setting, elves druids and arcane sorcerers coexist with steam locomotives,
firearms and mechanical automatons, in a dichotomy of ancient and modern where the old traditions will have to adapt to the new age,
fight to survive, or succumb to the unstoppable advance of cogworks and science.
