[Skyfarer] is a pen-and-paper RPG set in the universe of [Fallen London], specifically in the same
setting as [Sunless Skies], the third game of the series by [Failbetter Games].  
It's a simple system that emphasize narrative and characters over numbers and mechanics.

However, being very flexible and open means there are no official "adventures" published for the game,
with only some suggestions and pitches published as an addendum to make your own.

This website collects various materials that I wrote for Skyfarer to run my games, such as [quests](@/skyfarer/quests/_index.md), [encounters](@/skyfarer/encounters/_index.md),
new items and characters and full-fledged campaigns. **This content is considered unofficial fan work,
