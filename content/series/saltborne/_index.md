Welcome to **Saltborne**, a Solo RPG series by [Matteo Joliveau] powered by the [Ironsworn] RPG system.

This series is set in [Iurevar] and follows the adventures of **Ami Palanis**, a young half-elf with a mysterious past.

## How this works

This is a Solo RPG. There is no Game Master, there are no other players. It's just me, the dice, and my imagination. Ironswon uses a particular move called *Ask the Oracle* to generate answers and plot twists. When making this move, I roll a percentile die (actually one `d100` and one `d10` combined together) and check the result against a bunch of tables. You'll see a box like this whenever I make such a roll.

{{< ironsworn/oracle-roll 53 />}}

Click on the box to open it and see the result, or don't if you don't want to spoil the fiction with mechanical stuff. All rolls throughout the game will be presented in this fashion. An *action roll* made to check the result of a move will be presented like this.

{{< ironsworn/action-roll challenge_1=7 challenge_2=4 action=4 stat=2 />}}

The series is written entirely from the character's point of view, like you're reading her journal. Whenever I (the player) want to chime in and comment on stuff, you'll see a box like this.

## Publishing schedule

I don't want to commit on a specific regular schedule I may not be able to respect. Life always gets in the way and this is just a fun hobby for me to decompress. I will try however to be fairly regular, aiming at one post per month on average. Hopefully I'll be able to maintain a steady rate of publishing.
